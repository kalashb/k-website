        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>I'm Kalash, a passionate computer engineering student with an interest in embedded systems, robotics, and machine learning.</p>
        <p>I strive to build innovative solutions and solve complex problems through a combination of hardware and software expertise.</p>
        <p>I'm from Jalgaon, a small town in Maharashtra (India). I've been interested in challenging myself through olympiads and competitions since and early age. Starting with regional competitions like the State Scholarship Exams (I credit them as my curiosity enablers), I went on to attempt <a href="awards.html"> International Olympiads </a> just to find fun in test taking and challenges. The journey taught me about handling success and failures, took me to a 4-year study abroad in Singapore during my high school (which was terminated due to the pandemic within a year of study), and a 4-year study abroad in Canada at the University of Toronto where I am right now.</p>
        <p>I'm thankful to my parents, friends, teachers, and everyone else who played a big role in the journey and I'm grateful to have had a chance to interact with people I met on the way.</p>
