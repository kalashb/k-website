        BioCompute Inc.</a> |  Bangalore, India </p>
    <p style="padding: 0 50px; text-align: left; font-size: 1.2em; 
    line-height: 1.6;">During the summer of 2024, I worked as an Electrical Engineering 
    Intern at BioCompute Inc., building a nanopore sequencer for DNA reading. The goal was 
    to build a device for long term storage of information, trying to harness the 
    power of <b>DNA storage</b>. 
    I collaborated with a multidisciplinary team of five 
    professionals from marketing, physics, and biology to develop an innovative 
    DNA sequencing device. My primary responsibilities included designing the core 
    circuitry for the sequencer, ensuring optimal performance, reliability, and 
    integration with system requirements. </p>
    <p style="padding: 0 50px; text-align: left; font-size: 1.2em; 
    line-height: 1.6;"> I created detailed electrical schematics 
    and PCB layouts using Altium Designer, performed thermal and electrical simulations 
    in COMSOL Multiphysics, and developed 3D models for component integration using 
    Fusion360. I contributed to iterative prototyping, testing, and troubleshooting, 
    while also aligning technical specifications with the project's biological and 
    commercial objectives. This role allowed me to gain hands-on experience in 
    bioelectronics, focusing on power management, signal processing, and device 
    miniaturization. By the end of the internship, I delivered a comprehensive 
    report on the circuitry design and simulation results, advancing the overall 
    development pipeline for the sequencer.</p>
