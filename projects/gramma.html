    <h2>Gramma Cooked: AI-Powered Nostalgic Recipe Generator</h2>
    <p>
        Gramma Cooked is an AI-driven chatbot designed to transform a list of ingredients or an uploaded photo 
        into a personalized culinary experience. By leveraging advanced image recognition and natural language 
        processing, the chatbot identifies available ingredients, asks for your preferred cuisine or cultural 
        flavors, and generates traditional recipes rooted in nostalgia. Users can customize their requests with 
        tags or comments to refine their results, making it a versatile tool for rediscovering the joy of home-cooked meals.
    </p>
    <p>
        This project was built using a tech stack that included Flask for the backend, React and TypeScript 
        for the frontend, and Cohere's NLP tools for language processing. Our team also integrated APIs to handle 
        real-time image-to-ingredient recognition and connected a curated recipe database to deliver accurate and 
        culturally rich results. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The development process involved overcoming challenges like fine-tuning image recognition models, building 
        a responsive user interface, and ensuring the recipe suggestions were authentic and diverse. Through this 
        project, I strengthened my skills in full-stack development, machine learning integration, and cross-functional 
        collaboration in a high-pressure hackathon environment.
